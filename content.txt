<p class="text-wide mobile">The country you probably thought was in Africa, Guyana is the only English speaking country in South America. It’s also one of the most diverse regions in the world, we celebrate 6 peoples in our national anthem (Indigenous, East Indian, African, Portuguese, European and Chinese). Each culture brought their cuisine with them making for unique foods. Our sauce is no different, combining spices originating from African and Asian cultures with a Carribean twist.</p>

<h2 class="big-title mobile">FLAVOR <br>MEET HEAT<br></h2>
<p class="text-wide mobile">Most hot sauces have a forward Vinegar taste, with a back-note of heat, with very little nod to other ingredients. Mama Joyce's Peppa Sauce is unique in flavor, it is not only hot, but has spices that are indigenous to the African, Asian cultures, we use Cumin, Curry Powder and other spices that separates my hot sauce from others. We can’t give you all the secrets so you’ll just have to try it!</p>
